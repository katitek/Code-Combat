###### _Attributes (HTML)_

`attributes` are pieces of information or data which is included inside of the HTML `tags` themselves. For example, `<img>` tags have a mandatory attribute called `src` which is the URL "source" for the image.

To add an `attribute` to an HTML tag, include it between the `<` and `>`. It must have a `=` and `"` surrounding the value assigned to that value. Not much different from creating a variable! But instead, you are setting the value for the `tag`.

```html
<img src=""/file/db/thang.type/52cee45a76ebd5196b00003a/portrait.png" />
```

###### _The image tag `<img>`_

The `<img>` tag is used for adding image to the page. The `<img>` tag requires _URL_ inside it's `src` attribute to understand what image to display.

To add an `attribute` include it between the `<` and `>`.

**Example:**

```html
<img src='/file/db/thang.type
    /54eb540b49fa2d5c905ddf1a/portrait.png'>
    is a image on my webpage!
```
